In this android application, I implemented an in air gesture recognizer, which allows a user to create a template for each gesture by drawing the gesture using the phone in the air and then performs a real-time recognition. 

This android application has been tested on Android 4.x and Android 6.0 systems. The testing devices being used are Samsung Galaxy Nexus, LG G3.  

If you want to use the code for your own project, please contact Mingming Fan at fmmbupt@gmail.com
