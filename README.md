# In-Air real-time user-defined gesture recognizer

I present you an in-air real-time user-defined gesture recognizer, which allows a user to create a template for each gesture by drawing the gesture using the phone in the air and then performs a real-time recognition. 

This android application has been tested on Android 4.x and Android 6.0 systems. The testing devices being used are Samsung Galaxy Nexus, LG G3.  

How to use it?
1. Enter the name for each gesture in the text field;
2. Touch your finger down on the screen to initialize the data collection process;
3. Lift you finger up to stop the data collection process;
4. Draw the gesture in the air between the above step 2 and step 3;
5. Repeat the above steps 1-4 for each gesture that you are interested in to recognize;
6. Press the button at the bottom to switch to the real-time recognition mode. Now draw a gesture in the air following the above step 1-4, then the system will show the recognized gesture by prompting a message.


Now this code project is currently for my students in the CSC428/CSC2514 class at University of Toronto to use. 

If you want to use the code for your own project, please contact Mingming Fan at fmmbupt@gmail.com to get the permission.
